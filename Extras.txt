# 1. An option to view the original data
# 2. An option to view the resampled data
# 3. An option to view the prediction data of the model SMA, EMA, ESA0.3 and ESA0.7
# 4. An option to view the prediction of the ARIMA model
# 5. An option to view the prediction of the LSTM model
# 6. An option to view the plots of the resampled vs original data
# 7. An option to view the plots of the resampled data
# 8. An option to view the plots of the prediction data of the model SMA, EMA, ESA0.3, ESA0.7, Arima and LSTM. 
# 9. An option to view the RMSE values of all the predictions.
